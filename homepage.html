				<h1>About us</h1>
				
				<p>CoderDojo is a not-for-profit organization founded by James Whelton & Bill Liao. It was first started in James Whelton’s school in early 2011 when 
				James received some publicity after hacking the iPod Nano and some younger students expressed an interest in learning how to code. He setup a computer 
				club in his school (PBC Cork) where he started teaching basic HTML and CSS.</p>
				<p>Later that year he met Bill Liao, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, who was interested in growing the project into something bigger than just an 
				after-school computer club. In July 2011 the first CoderDojo was launched in the National Software Centre in Cork where CoderDojo saw extreme success. 
				The Cork Dojo saw people travelling from Dublin frequently to attend sessions. Owing to this popularity a Dublin Dojo was launched soon after in Google’s 
				Montevetro building. The increasing success lead to the setup of more Dojos around Ireland and subsequently around the world.</p>
				<p>At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run and taught by volunteers. 
				Dojos organise tours of technology companies, bring in guest speakers to talk about their career and what they do, and organise events. In addition to 
				learning to code, members meet like-minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a 
				fun & sociable experience. CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers 
				globally.</p>
				
				<h1><abbr title="Cork Institute of Technology">CIT</abbr> CoderDojo</h1>
				<p>It seemed only natural that Cork Institute of Technology would also has its own CoderDojo chapter given that innovation & cultivating entrepreneurial 
				spirit are paramount within the institute. At <abbr title="Cork Institute of Technology">CIT</abbr> this movement is divided into two different categories:</p>
